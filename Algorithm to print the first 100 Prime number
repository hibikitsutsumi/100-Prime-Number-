_____Variables_____
number 
divisor
remainder 

_____Initialize_____ 
number=1
divisor=2

_____Process 1_____
If(number<2)
Yes - print "It's not prime!"
No  - increment by 1
process again

If(numbers=2)
Yes - print "number is prime"
No  - increment by 1
process again 

If(number>2)
go to the next step  

_____Process 2_____
remainder=number % devisor(2)
If(remaider=0)
It's not prime number , number+=1, devisor= 2 process again 

Else
divisor +=1
If (number+devisor)
print "number is prime" number+=1, devisor=2 process again 

Else 
process again
